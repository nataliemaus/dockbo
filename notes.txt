Currently running lightdock w/ Nruns 10 to see if we still get good diagonal result



#  11/10/21 SABDAB 

1. If we give trubo the true configuration (no rotation or translation),
#   it can easily improve the score by epsilon, but does so by making tiny 
#   tiny changes to known pose which is valid. 
#   (see sabadab_best_poses1 for dfire and sabadab_best_poses1 for dfire2)

Next: 
- next we want to fix this by not giving turbo the opportunity 
        to cheat with the known pose (start from scratch)
- when we start from scratch it takes a while for it to find anything
    at all with positive energy score
    we want to see if we can recover the best pose via optimization 
    also want to record the translation and rotation vectors 
    (magnitude of translation, degrees of rotation? )
    - 0 translaation and 0 degrees rotation == correct pose 










DOCKBO TODO
1. Add restraints to dfire, dfire2 scoring functions for dockbo version of things 
    (Currently dfire, dfire2 work but don't recover true pose even with tons of optimization time)

LIGHTDOCK TODO:
1. Figure out how to add restraints w/ nanonet. 


RUNNING 
1. Creating lightdock matrix with abrestrained only (can we remove issue of restraining nanonet things)
    1a.  If that dosesn't work, must fix nanonet restraints? 
2. Then Run test_dockbo.py once w/ dfire and once w/ dfire2 to create restrained dockbo matrix!! 

TODO/ RUN 
1. Restart the random sampling experiments (hopefully can do those w/ dockbo rather than lightdock!) (TODO, TBD)
