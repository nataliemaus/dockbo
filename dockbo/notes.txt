running 

1. dockbo with 3 tr restarts bighat (-dfire2), bighat2 (dfire2)
    Do either recover the actual known position? 

2. lightdock both restrained with dfire2 to see if we get same diagonal :)
    i.e. is dfire2 a valid scoring function like dfire is? 

    Note: the restrains themselves contribute to the score which could be messing w/ things.
